        >Nowadays, every innovation builds on countless previous developments.
        Just with the invention of the printing press, there wouldn&#39;t be any
        books. Materials and processes, like paper, ink, and binding, are
        disciplines that have been optimized over centuries. The book, as we
        know it today, would not be conceivable without collaboration and the
        sharing of knowledge.</span

        >Although the printing press and the internet have made it possible to
        share knowledge like never before, companies, politics, and
        unfortunately, research often take a different path. Patent knowledge
        and technical solutions as ownable goods is a comparatively young idea
        in human history. This leads to technical knowledge being collected and
        privatized by individual companies. They determine which ideas are
        pursued and which are not, often based on economic factors, with
        ecological and social arguments being secondary.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Hardware refers to tangible objects, such as furniture, textiles,
        machines, or electronic devices. Open-source hardware involves making
        the knowledge to replicate and further develop these products freely
        accessible. This includes all relevant information like design,
        construction, components, and instructions, collectively referred to as
        documentation. This allows people worldwide to learn from the
        experiences and innovations of others and develop new ideas based on
        this knowledge.</span

    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >By having open access to this knowledge, users can understand how a
        product works and how it is made or replicated. This creates trust and
        transparency regarding quality, safety, and sustainability. Various
        approaches can be developed and tested in co-creative processes.</span

        Individuals and different groups, such as NGOs, companies, and research
        institutes, share common inventions and form a community of interest.
        Motivations vary, including progress, community, global justice, and

      <span class="c0"
        >The vision of open-source hardware (OSH) is to make technology
        accessible to all humanity, promoting the common good. OSH seeks a
        collective knowledge base and serves the freedom to learn. The
        principles of the circular economy, which are fundamental to open-source
        hardware, focus on sustainable resource use. This leads to the
        development of environmentally friendly innovations and technologies
        that conserve resources and minimize waste.</span

    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >The open-source approach ensures repairability, availability of spare
        parts, and minimizes waste. Local, adaptable productions are promoted to
        meet community and individual needs. Transparency and accessibility of
        knowledge encourage collaboration on collective projects to solve
        societal challenges. OSH supports the longevity of technologies and
        their rapid, targeted scalability and reproducibility through innovative
        decentralized production methods. The diversity of skills promotes
        holistic development, and the community motivates everyone to
        participate and learn, leading to diverse projects where knowledge is
        built collectively.</span

    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>

        >People can actively participate to promote their self-realization and
        be creative and productive. This allows them to make a difference while
        bringing in personal skills and interests. The open nature of OSH
        encourages working together on challenges and creating innovative
        solutions, a significant source of individual fulfillment and collective
        progress.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >There are many ways for OSH business models, with resources being
        accessed in different ways. Increasingly, OSH projects receive funding
        from countries, federal governments, or the EU. Large corporations
        recognize the opportunities and invest in the movement and specific
        project developments.</span

    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >However, the most important support OSH receives is from the people
        forming a community. They engage directly in the development process,
        improving and expanding it with diverse knowledge. Different areas of
        expertise are managed by individual competencies. The community also
        contributes financially. Besides donations, the product is purchased in
        its entirety, as a kit, or in specific individual parts. Financial
        support for development comes from individual motivations, with people
        actively participating in progress and supporting the OSH
        movement.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Unlike proprietary projects, where there is a clear separation between
        producers and consumers, OSH overcomes this boundary and allows users to
        become prosumers. This role means more than just consuming &ndash;
        prosumers can be part of the development processes. They have the option
        to actively participate in product design without necessarily being part
        of the core team. This creates a cooperative network between those who
        use products and those who design them.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Despite its many advantages, the OSH idea is only beginning to realize
        its potential. Possible challenges include traditional business models,
        intellectual property, and market structures prioritizing commercial
        interests. To promote dissemination, these need to be reconsidered.
        Knowledge transfer and active engagement require time and resources.
        Awareness of OSH must also grow to support broader recognition.
        Particularly, open-source hardware should be more firmly anchored in
        educational institutions to enable future generations to access the
        collaborative mindset.</span

        online platforms. Development starts with project proposals and ideas.
        Using version control systems like Git, changes are coordinated, often
        by creating forks (copies) of the project before merging them into the
        main project. Open exchange occurs through commenting and

        >Moe: The open-source hardware movement gained significant momentum in
        the USA in the early 2000s. Marcin Jakubowski founded the &quot;Open
        Source Ecology&quot; network and the central project &quot;Global
        Village Construction Set.&quot; In 2011, his widely referenced TED talk
        created quite a stir globally. In Germany, the response was particularly
        sustainable, leading to the formation of a relatively stable community
        under the label &quot;Open Source Ecology Germany.&quot; Initially, the
        development of open-source hardware was almost exclusively based on
        &quot;self-exploitation&quot; &ndash; people invested their free time or
        donated money directly to individuals within the community. It quickly
        became clear that this was not a sustainable business model. It also
        became apparent that a legal entity was needed to manage collective
        property (such as a solar plant) and conduct PR for political demands.
        However, it wasn&#39;t until 2016 that the non-profit association
        &quot;Open Source Ecology Germany e. V.&quot; was officially
        founded.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Moe: The association was understood from the beginning as a pure tool
        for the community &ndash; essentially a legal vehicle that allows us to
        do various things. It primarily serves as an interface to the &quot;old
        world.&quot; In other words, conventional organizations find it very
        difficult to enter into contracts with a community. The association
        forms the legal bridge for this. For example, as a non-profit
        association with a research purpose, we can acquire and manage public
        funding for open-source hardware development &ndash; which has become by
        far our main source of income. We can carry out public relations,
        especially political, much more effectively. Together, we can appear
        under the label of a non-profit legal entity at major conferences, sit
        on committees and panels, and draft statements on legislative proposals
        of the Thuringian State Parliament. All of this is managed collectively
        and without any form of command chains or classical hierarchy patterns.
        If we did, the association would lose its connection to the community
        and thus its founding purpose. Ultimately, the association is like a
        Swiss Army knife for the community.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Over the years, it has also increasingly taken on a platform character.
        The association maintains a fairly decent digital and physical
        infrastructure for its members and the community: Nextcloud, GitLab,
        Hedgedoc, forum, wiki, email mailboxes, etc. on the digital side, as
        well as OpenEcoLabs, tools, machines, office and seminar rooms on the
        physical side. We offer everything a willing developer needs to turn an
        idea into well-documented open-source hardware or take it to the next
        level. In our community, we also pool a lot of expertise, from
        documentation guidelines to legal questions and business models. Much of
        this expertise is networked through the association and its
        infrastructure &ndash; and there are always people involved. They often
        become members and expand the association further &ndash; and so new
        tools are added to the Swiss Army knife, so to speak.</span

        >Moe: My personal favorite project in the association is
        &quot;ZAC+,&quot; a zinc-air fuel cell. The maintainer behind it is
        Oliver Schl&uuml;ter. The problem was that Oli could store the energy
        from his solar plant with battery systems from day to night, but not
        sensibly from summer to winter. So, a long-term storage solution was
        needed that is relatively easy to manufacture and maintain, without
        toxic or extremely expensive materials. Such a system could be
        manufactured almost anywhere in the world and repaired independently of
        the manufacturer. Zinc and oxygen are an excellent combination for this
        purpose. Industrial solutions have never really taken off, but they were
        more aimed at integrated battery systems. The peculiarity of ZAC+ is
        that the &quot;combustion process&quot; (electricity generation) and the
        &quot;recycling process&quot; (electricity storage) take place in two
        different stationary devices. This makes the system much simpler, more
        robust, and cheaper. Oli started with small table setups, mostly
        self-financed, and the association occasionally supported him with
        donation funds. Later, adjacent projects (such as the OpenNanoGrid) also
        received funding, which of course gave the project a boost. In
        cooperation with universities, mathematical and chemical theses could
        also be written. We also had a cooperation with an engineering office
        for several years, which was also a supporting member of the association
        at that time. Without the association as a legal entity, much of this
        would have been difficult to impossible.</span

        >Moe: As a non-profit association, we are not committed to a business
        model but to our statutes, our non-profit purpose, and thus our values.
        As a community-based association, we also have a very different
        administrative structure than conventional associations. One-sided
        communication and decisions, unnecessary bureaucracy, or command chains
        simply do not work in a community context. And without the community,
        the association wouldn&#39;t exist! We couldn&#39;t implement any of our
        projects or meaningfully serve any of our statutory purposes. All
        members of the association are also part of the community, and without
        this connection, we couldn&#39;t work. Consequently, everything
        developed in the association is open source. All our developments are
        thus independent of the association and can be further developed in
        another part of the world. This model alone protects the association
        from becoming corrupted.</span

        >Moe: The preamble to the DIN SPEC 3105 already states that we aim for a
        technological mainstream. It is important that not only in science but
        also in all publicly funded areas, open source becomes the standard
        solution. Otherwise, research from countries with less industrial
        infrastructure would be excluded. The vision is for OSH to become an
        industrial mainstream as well. This would fundamentally change our
        economy and its ecological compatibility &ndash; towards cooperative
        economies. Of course, there are also certain market entry barriers with
        open-source hardware. However, the old question of ownership is very
        elegantly solved, in my opinion:</span

        it&rsquo;s a state or a company &ndash; as long as everyone has the
        right and the means to manufacture and further develop it. The next
        step, in my view, is to continue professionalizing collective technology
        development: product certification, clinical approval of medical
        technology, internal community quality standards, etc. These processes
        also need to be made more open to facilitate cooperative work. This has
        a lot to do with standardization, but also with scalable models for
        community-based organizational leadership. We as a movement still need
        to grow into this. And that is happening right now. It&#39;s already
        pretty cool.</span

        ecological change at a low threshold. In short, I think it has never
        been so easy to work for social transformation and make a living from it
        if you want to. You don&#39;t have to sell your soul or sacrifice your
        future. None of that &ndash; you can just do it. And that is such a huge
        privilege that I, as a white, cis-male Central European with an academic
        background, almost feel it is my duty to use it. I have always waited
        for the day when my activism would hit hard limits, receive threatening
        calls, and the like. That I could no longer continue or couldn&#39;t

        >When starting a startup, you get a lot of (unsolicited) advice. Before
        you even start implementing an idea, you are pressured to patent it.
        Unfortunately, many founders take this step without adequately
        considering the possible consequences. The biggest challenge for us was
        to find a unique selling proposition (USP) that is not based on the
        product itself (as it can theoretically be copied by others). In our
        case, we focus on high product quality and transparency around the
        product itself, as well as a local value chain and a &quot;no-bullshit
        brand&quot; on sustainability.</span

        same time, we create full transparency about what is in our products and
        spread repair-friendly designs among makers and industrial companies.
        The benefits we see include reducing negative impacts on the planet
        through decentralized production of repairable products; building a
        faster, better, and more inclusive product development process; moving
        people from consumers to prosumers - as informed, proactive shapers of
        society; and ultimately strengthening our brand by being transparent and

        Machines&quot; (October 2022 to September 2023), three products were
        accompanied through the review process, with the documentation reviewed
        for completeness according to DIN SPEC 3105. The new aspect of this
        project was that a rebuild was conducted. This is an extension of the
        review with a practical component. Besides completeness, the

        the kitchen mixer re:Mix, and the CNC mill MakersMill. To systematically
        capture questions and comments on the documentation, issues (tasks) were
        created in OSEG Gitlab. This way, the review and rebuild process is
        openly documented and can be reviewed and further developed in the

        went through the review and rebuild process. This was done in
        cooperation with the Berlin University of Applied Sciences. In the
        Master&#39;s program in Physical Engineering - Medical Physics (M.Eng.),
        two students reviewed the documentation according to DIN SPEC 3105 and
        then rebuilt the 3D printer. The module is called Physical Metrology and
        is led by Prof. Dr. Ingeborg Beckers. An interview with Prof. Beckers

        where the documentation is checked. The idea is to ensure the
        documentation contains all necessary information. From January to March
        2023, the rebuild took place, where the kit was assembled, and the
        documentation was subjected to a practical test.</span

        Schl&uuml;ter and is based on the UniPro-Kit. The Universal Prototyping
        Kit offers versatile parts and modules to enable developers to create
        prototypes with modular flexibility. Thus, the MakersMill provides a
        solid foundation for various milling projects and allows for adjustments
        and extensions to itself.</span

    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >In January 2021, the MakersMill went through the review process and is
        thus certified according to DIN SPEC 3105. It was also included in the
        current project to go through the rebuild process as well. It was
        decided to rewrite the documentation. We learned a lot from this. The
        developers of the products often suffer from expert blindness, meaning
        they have difficulty putting themselves in the shoes of people without
        prior knowledge and identifying fundamental gaps in knowledge.
        Especially in open-source hardware documentation, this perspective is
        crucial, as the products must be fundamentally explained. On the
        following pages, the creation of documentation is explored in more
        detail.</span

        This was done in cooperation with the Rollwerk, a makerspace in
        Berlin-Neuk&ouml;lln. Since the MakersMill consists of many individual
        parts, this was a very complex task. In the following months, the
        MakersMill went through the review and then a rebuild again.</span

        Production Technologies&quot; course led by Dr. Daniel Wessolek. During
        the rebuild, a deeper level of production was chosen: All required 3D

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Only when the OSH product can be replicated and modified can
        collaboration truly happen. The documentation of the OSH project is
        therefore the central medium of collaboration. It should spark interest
        in the project and motivate people to get involved.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >To build a community, communicate with it, and receive helpful
        contributions, good open documentation is indispensable. Writing
        documentation itself brings another benefit for the internal project
        team. Formulating thoughts and justifying decisions leads to questioning
        oneself and taking another perspective.</span

    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >There are many types of documentation. This section and DIN SPEC 3105
        do not prescribe how documentation should be designed. Instead, it
        encourages active creation and viewing of the project&#39;s
        documentation as an independent and important part of the project.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"

        are precisely described. &quot;M6 screw&quot; is not as specific as the
        somewhat cryptic designation: &quot;EN ISO 4762 M6&times;40&quot;. This
        clearly defines the head shape, length, and diameter. It is generally
        advisable to use as many standard parts as possible since they are

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >- **Purchased Parts**: For purchased parts (like electric motors), it
        is crucial to provide the exact product name, manufacturer, and
        performance description. More information is better than less. For
        replication, it is important to find the exact motor quickly. When
        modifying, it is also interesting to know why this particular motor was
        chosen.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >With a detailed BOM and assembly instructions, the right to replicate
        is already secured. To understand what a documentation must include to
        make a project not only replicable but also modifiable, it helps to
        focus on the assembly instructions themselves. Even the best
        instructions will likely have some errors, and it would be great if the
        community could easily fix these.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >If you upload your instructions as a PDF, people who find an error can
        only copy everything error-free and send you the PDF. This is cumbersome
        and does not allow modifications. If you also upload the files from
        which you created the PDF, others can open these files (provided they
        have the right program), modify them, and then create a new PDF. These
        files are called &quot;source files.&quot; They save your community a
        lot of work and make it much easier for them to get started and
        collaborate. So, it is important to provide not only the final product
        but also all the source files.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Source files are typically program-dependent, and editing these files
        can be expensive due to license costs. Therefore, it is important to
        provide an export version in an easily accessible format in addition to
        the source files. The PDF format for instructions is convenient because
        it can be opened without expensive software. In the case of machine
        parts, the export format can be a technical drawing, a .step file for 3D
        printed parts, or a FreeCAD file because FreeCAD is freely accessible.
        The export format is not fixed, but you should keep in mind to make it
        as easy as possible for your readers to open and use the file.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Open-source hardware is evolving from a niche phenomenon to a promising
        approach to organizing technology in various forms globally,
        sustainably, and humanely. Humanity faces a series of global challenges,
        and the conventional approach to technology development is simply no
        longer sufficient. For open-source hardware to be a real alternative,
        the infrastructure must continue to develop so that projects can further
        professionalize. Below is a selection of problem areas we are addressing
        within the OSEG community to realize this vision.</span
