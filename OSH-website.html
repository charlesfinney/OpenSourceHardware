          <p>
            Nowadays, every innovation builds on countless previous
            developments. Just with the invention of the printing press, there
            wouldn't be any books. Materials and processes, like paper, ink, and
            binding, are disciplines that have been optimized over centuries.
            The book, as we know it today, would not be conceivable without
            collaboration and the sharing of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the printing press and the internet have made it possible
            to share knowledge like never before, companies, politics, and
            unfortunately, research often take a different path. Patent
            knowledge and technical solutions as ownable goods is a
            comparatively young idea in human history. This leads to technical
            knowledge being collected and privatized by individual companies.
            They determine which ideas are pursued and which are not, often
            based on economic factors, with ecological and social arguments
            being secondary.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea behind open-source hardware is to optimize resource use and
            tackle global challenges together. An open invention can democratize
            knowledge and activate the community's innovative power.

        <h2>What is Open-Source Hardware?</h2>
        <div class="expandable-content">
          <p>
            Hardware refers to tangible objects, such as furniture, textiles,
            machines, or electronic devices. Open-source hardware involves
            making the knowledge to replicate and further develop these products
            freely accessible. This includes all relevant information like
            design, construction, components, and instructions, collectively
            referred to as documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            By having open access to this knowledge, users can understand how a
            product works and how it is made or replicated. This creates trust
            and transparency regarding quality, safety, and sustainability.
            Various approaches can be developed and tested in co-creative
            processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The community forms the basis of the open-source hardware movement.
            Individuals and different groups, such as NGOs, companies, and
            research institutes, share common inventions and form a community of
            interest. Motivations vary, including progress, community, global
            justice, and idealistic values.

            The vision of open-source hardware (OSH) is to make technology
            accessible to all humanity, promoting the common good. OSH seeks a
            collective knowledge base and serves the freedom to learn. The
            principles of the circular economy, which are fundamental to
            open-source hardware, focus on sustainable resource use. This leads
            to the development of environmentally friendly innovations and
            technologies that conserve resources and minimize waste.
          </p>
          <p>
            The open-source approach ensures repairability, availability of
            spare parts, and minimizes waste. Local, adaptable productions are
            promoted to meet community and individual needs. Transparency and
            accessibility of knowledge encourage collaboration on collective
            projects to solve societal challenges. OSH supports the longevity of
            technologies and their rapid, targeted scalability and
            reproducibility through innovative decentralized production methods.
            The diversity of skills promotes holistic development, and the
            community motivates everyone to participate and learn, leading to
            diverse projects where knowledge is built collectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            People can actively participate to promote their self-realization
            and be creative and productive. This allows them to make a
            difference while bringing in personal skills and interests. The open
            nature of OSH encourages working together on challenges and creating
            innovative solutions, a significant source of individual fulfillment
            and collective progress.

        <div class="expandable-content">
          <p>
            There are many ways for OSH business models, with resources being
            accessed in different ways. Increasingly, OSH projects receive
            funding from countries, federal governments, or the EU. Large
            corporations recognize the opportunities and invest in the movement
            and specific project developments.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the most important support OSH receives is from the people
            forming a community. They engage directly in the development
            process, improving and expanding it with diverse knowledge.
            Different areas of expertise are managed by individual competencies.
            The community also contributes financially. Besides donations, the
            product is purchased in its entirety, as a kit, or in specific
            individual parts. Financial support for development comes from
            individual motivations, with people actively participating in
            progress and supporting the OSH movement.

        <div class="expandable-content">
          <p>
            Unlike proprietary projects, where there is a clear separation
            between producers and consumers, OSH overcomes this boundary and
            allows users to become prosumers. This role means more than just
            consuming &ndash; prosumers can be part of the development
            processes. They have the option to actively participate in product
            design without necessarily being part of the core team. This creates
            a cooperative network between those who use products and those who
            design them.

        <div class="expandable-content">
          <p>
            Despite its many advantages, the OSH idea is only beginning to
            realize its potential. Possible challenges include traditional
            business models, intellectual property, and market structures
            prioritizing commercial interests. To promote dissemination, these
            need to be reconsidered. Knowledge transfer and active engagement
            require time and resources. Awareness of OSH must also grow to
            support broader recognition. Particularly, open-source hardware
            should be more firmly anchored in educational institutions to enable
            future generations to access the collaborative mindset.

          How Does Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing Work in the Community?
        </h2>
        <div class="expandable-content">
          <p>
            Collaboration extends through personal interactions in real life and
            online platforms. Development starts with project proposals and
            ideas. Using version control systems like Git, changes are
            coordinated, often by creating forks (copies) of the project before
            merging them into the main project. Open exchange occurs through
            commenting and discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the world of open-source software, there are remarkable examples.
            Linux, an open-source operating system, is developed by an
            international community and widely used. Blender, a popular
            open-source 3D graphics software, also benefits from collaborative
            development. These projects successfully use similar principles to
            create high-quality and accessible software for everyone.

              Martin Häuer, also known as Moe, is a project coordinator,
              activist, researcher and developer in the open source hardware
              sector. He has been with OSEG e.V. since 2018 and has also grown
              shortly after joining the board. He is mainly interested in the
              meta-topics: Community-based organisational governance,
              standardisation and the socio-economic and socio-ecological impact
              of open source hardware. He is currently working at the Open
              Source Imaging Initiative on the further development of an open
              source MRI and its organisational infrastructure.

            <h3>
              How did the "Open Source Ecology Germany e. V." Association Come
              About?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Moe: The open-source hardware movement gained significant momentum
              in the USA in the early 2000s. Marcin Jakubowski founded the "Open
              Source Ecology" network and the central project "Global Village
              Construction Set." In 2011, his widely referenced TED talk created
              quite a stir globally. In Germany, the response was particularly
              sustainable, leading to the formation of a relatively stable
              community under the label "Open Source Ecology Germany."
              Initially, the development of open-source hardware was almost
              exclusively based on "self-exploitation" – people invested their
              free time or donated money directly to individuals within the
              community. It quickly became clear that this was not a sustainable
              business model. It also became apparent that a legal entity was
              needed to manage collective property (such as a solar plant) and
              conduct PR for political demands. However, it wasn't until 2016
              that the non-profit association "Open Source Ecology Germany e.
              V." was officially founded.
            </p>
            <h3>What Function Does the Association Serve for the Community?</h3>
            <p>
              Moe: The association was understood from the beginning as a pure
              tool for the community – essentially a legal vehicle that allows
              us to do various things. It primarily serves as an interface to
              the "old world." In other words, conventional organizations find
              it very difficult to enter into contracts with a community. The
              association forms the legal bridge for this. For example, as a
              non-profit association with a research purpose, we can acquire and
              manage public funding for open-source hardware development – which
              has become by far our main source of income. We can carry out
              public relations, especially political, much more effectively.
              Together, we can appear under the label of a non-profit legal
              entity at major conferences, sit on committees and panels, and
              draft statements on legislative proposals of the Thuringian State
              Parliament. All of this is managed collectively and without any
              form of command chains or classical hierarchy patterns. If we did,
              the association would lose its connection to the community and
              thus its founding purpose. Ultimately, the association is like a
              Swiss Army knife for the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, it has also increasingly taken on a platform
              character. The association maintains a fairly decent digital and
              physical infrastructure for its members and the community:
              Nextcloud, GitLab, Hedgedoc, forum, wiki, email mailboxes, etc. on
              the digital side, as well as OpenEcoLabs, tools, machines, office
              and seminar rooms on the physical side. We offer everything a
              willing developer needs to turn an idea into well-documented
              open-source hardware or take it to the next level. In our
              community, we also pool a lot of expertise, from documentation
              guidelines to legal questions and business models. Much of this
              expertise is networked through the association and its
              infrastructure – and there are always people involved. They often
              become members and expand the association further – and so new
              tools are added to the Swiss Army knife, so to speak.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Can you briefly introduce a project within the association?</h3>
          <p>
            Moe: My personal favorite project in the association is
            &quot;ZAC+,&quot; a zinc-air fuel cell. The maintainer behind it is
            Oliver Schl&uuml;ter. The problem was that Oli could store the
            energy from his solar plant with battery systems from day to night,
            but not sensibly from summer to winter. So, a long-term storage
            solution was needed that is relatively easy to manufacture and
            maintain, without toxic or extremely expensive materials. Such a
            system could be manufactured almost anywhere in the world and
            repaired independently of the manufacturer. Zinc and oxygen are an
            excellent combination for this purpose. Industrial solutions have
            never really taken off, but they were more aimed at integrated
            battery systems. The peculiarity of ZAC+ is that the
            &quot;combustion process&quot; (electricity generation) and the
            &quot;recycling process&quot; (electricity storage) take place in
            two different stationary devices. This makes the system much
            simpler, more robust, and cheaper. Oli started with small table
            setups, mostly self-financed, and the association occasionally
            supported him with donation funds. Later, adjacent projects (such as
            the OpenNanoGrid) also received funding, which of course gave the
            project a boost. In cooperation with universities, mathematical and
            chemical theses could also be written. We also had a cooperation
            with an engineering office for several years, which was also a
            supporting member of the association at that time. Without the
            association as a legal entity, much of this would have been
            difficult to impossible.
          </p>
          <h3>
            hat makes the association unique? And how does the association
            ensure that the voices of the community are heard?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Moe: As a non-profit association, we are not committed to a business
            model but to our statutes, our non-profit purpose, and thus our
            values. As a community-based association, we also have a very
            different administrative structure than conventional associations.
            One-sided communication and decisions, unnecessary bureaucracy, or
            command chains simply do not work in a community context. And
            without the community, the association wouldn&#39;t exist! We
            couldn&#39;t implement any of our projects or meaningfully serve any
            of our statutory purposes. All members of the association are also
            part of the community, and without this connection, we couldn&#39;t
            work. Consequently, everything developed in the association is open
            source. All our developments are thus independent of the association
            and can be further developed in another part of the world. This
            model alone protects the association from becoming corrupted.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we want to organize technologies collectively as humanity &ndash;
            and we must if we are to make it to the next century &ndash; it must
            be open-source hardware.
          </p>
          <h3>
            How do you see the future of OSH, and what development would you
            like to see?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Moe: The preamble to the DIN SPEC 3105 already states that we aim
            for a technological mainstream. It is important that not only in
            science but also in all publicly funded areas, open source becomes
            the standard solution. Otherwise, research from countries with less
            industrial infrastructure would be excluded. The vision is for OSH
            to become an industrial mainstream as well. This would fundamentally
            change our economy and its ecological compatibility &ndash; towards
            cooperative economies. Of course, there are also certain market
            entry barriers with open-source hardware. However, the old question
            of ownership is very elegantly solved, in my opinion:
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn&#39;t really matter who owns the individual machine,
            whether it&rsquo;s a state or a company &ndash; as long as everyone
            has the right and the means to manufacture and further develop it.
            The next step, in my view, is to continue professionalizing
            collective technology development: product certification, clinical
            approval of medical technology, internal community quality
            standards, etc. These processes also need to be made more open to
            facilitate cooperative work. This has a lot to do with
            standardization, but also with scalable models for community-based
            organizational leadership. We as a movement still need to grow into
            this. And that is happening right now. It&#39;s already pretty cool.
          </p>
          <h3>Any final thoughts or messages you would like to share?</h3>
          <p>
            Moe: I am here [at OSEG] because I didn&#39;t want to waste my life
            as an engineer in the industry but wanted to use my skills for the
            benefit of society. I can do this because of my privileges. We are
            building infrastructure here to enable people to advance
            socio-economic and ecological change at a low threshold. In short, I
            think it has never been so easy to work for social transformation
            and make a living from it if you want to. You don&#39;t have to sell
            your soul or sacrifice your future. None of that &ndash; you can
            just do it. And that is such a huge privilege that I, as a white,
            cis-male Central European with an academic background, almost feel
            it is my duty to use it. I have always waited for the day when my
            activism would hit hard limits, receive threatening calls, and the
            like. That I could no longer continue or couldn&#39;t because I
            lacked the means or lost the courage fighting windmills. None of
            that happened. They say nothing is stronger than an idea whose time
            has come. And this one is really overdue.

            Institute for Standardisation e. V. (DIN), more than 20 other parties, such as community
            community organisations, companies and universities were involved.</p>

            This should avoid misunderstandings and improve the quality and interoperability of

            helps to create a common basis for developers, manufacturers and users
            and users, which facilitates communication, cooperation and
            co-operation and knowledge exchange is facilitated. It contributes to the further development of the

        <h2>Review of Open Source Hardware</h2>
        <p>According to DIN SPEC 3105, the review process is carried out by a CAB
            (&quot;Conformity Assessment Body&quot;)“Konformitätsbewertungsstelle“. This is an independent body
            that checks and certifies the conformity of products, services, or
            processes with certain standards and requirements. In the context of
            open-source hardware, a CAB carries out the certification of OSH
            projects to ensure that the documentation meets the criteria of DIN SPEC
            3105.</p>
        <p>After the publication of DIN SPEC 3105, OSEG e.V. started setting up a
            CAB to gain experience with the review process and DIN SPEC. Any
            organization can set up a CAB as long as they store and make the review
            process and the reviewed documentation public. In addition to OSEG e.V.,
            OHO e.V. has also established a CAB and has already reviewed many projects.

        <p>We at Open Source Ecology Germany e.V. have decided to carry out the
            review process with the help of the community. We involve all interested
            parties to review the documentation, rebuild the products, and further
            develop the process together. On pages 28-35, we give you an insight
            into the latest projects that have gone through the review

      <section id="CAB 2021" class="section">
        <h2>CAB 2021</h2>
        <p>In the first round, we reviewed 15 open-source hardware documentations.
            Without going into detail about the specific projects, we would like to
            briefly explain what we learned about the review process.</p>
        <h3>1. Rebuilding in addition to the theoretical review</h3>
        <p>During the review of the MNT Reform open-source laptop, it became
            apparent that the project was so complex that it was very difficult for
            the reviewers to determine if all the information was available. A
            practical rebuild based on the documentation would have ensured this.
            For complex projects, a practical rebuild in addition to the theoretical
            review is helpful as it generates more valuable feedback.</p>
        <h3>2. Open-source hardware projects receive feedback</h3>
        <p>The documentation of an open-source hardware project benefits greatly
            from a critical and independent four-eye principle. Incomprehensible
            part descriptions are identified and avoided; sometimes, a picture is
            needed to make it clearer to rebuilders what it is about.</p>
        <h3>3. Community Building</h3>
        <p>The review process supports community building. Through the review, two
            people are brought closer to the project, requiring them to engage
            intensively with it.</p>
        <h3>4. Platform-independent reviewing</h3>
        <p>A project benefits from the analysis of the documentation even more if
            the reviewers use not only offline files or our platforms but also the
            project&#39;s platforms. They also test the documentation structure
            across different platforms and websites, putting themselves in the
            perspective of users who stumbled upon the project on the
            internet.</p>
            <p>When a rebuild is connected with the review process, it can be ensured
                that the documentation is complete, and the project receives detailed
                feedback. This is exactly the goal of the process shown in this booklet.
                In follow-up projects of the association, open-source hardware projects
                will not only be theoretically reviewed but also practically
                rebuilt.</p>

            The principles of openness, collaboration, and community-driven
